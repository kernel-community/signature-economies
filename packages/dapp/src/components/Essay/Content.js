                    Public blockchains present a paradox of ownership. No-one controls them and anyone can use them, given a connection and an ability to speak the common tongue. The network is ownerless, yet anyone who creates a key ‘owns’ any coins associated with it, so everyone is an owner. This confusion reveals how ‘ownership’ is shifting and highlights the opportunity we have to augment our understanding of ‘the ownership economy’ by reimagining what being an owner means.
                </div>
                <div>
                    We can begin this process by asking, “What do I actually control?”
                </div>
                <div>
                    In Bitcoin, I can sign over an unspent transaction output to another address. In Ethereum and other account-based models, I can sign a message which changes a value stored in shared state.<sup>1</sup> In each case, I am not the sole possessor or controller, I am a signatory on an event shared with everyone who participates in the network.
                </div>
                <div>
                    So, ownership in digital economies is really about meaningful signatures. Focusing on how we make <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/meaning/">meaning</a>, rather than who possesses which particular bit, can help us understand why shared state changes signed by many individuals are <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-1/value/">valuable</a>. A signature is both irreducibly unique—your signature dish, signature tune, signature shot—and that which binds you contractually to a world beyond yourself. It is both singular and iterable. By this mark, I make my meaning, I memorialise my being a witness to this moment. But I do not do this in isolation: my meaning must be read by others in order for it to hold real value.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Is ownership shifting from an ability to demonstrate control or possession to the ability to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://kernel.community/en/conversation/hospitality/">make collective meaning</a>? If so, the change in signification is a radical one, because ownership is traditionally about exclusive rights, whereas meaning is made valuable by <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/v2XqrFkyo68?t=1221">how widely it is shared</a>. The medium may be <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/8ZDEc7uFi64?t=3270">massaging ownership</a> to mean <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7v63TjdutE&t=2999s">more that it currently does</a>: “content can now be proliferated instead of protected”.<sup>2</sup> We may, for the first time online, design primarily for <a href="https://youtu.be/uN4g0Sr3jhs?t=1620">multiple, simultaneous use</a>, rather than individual consumption.

                    The Plural Good
                </div>

                <div>
                    How does making a sign differ from exerting control or claiming possession? Once claimed, possessed or controlled, the story is forced to a close, which is why the ‘ownership economy’ is singular. Someone wins and everyone else loses. However, signatures do not enclose, they bear individual witness to shared events. The messages you sign are at once totally unique—there is only one valid signer in the whole world—and yet they can be broadcast many times over, each time accumulating meaning. To quote Wendell Berry, “Perhaps our most serious cultural loss in recent centuries is the knowledge that some things, though limited, are inexhaustible.”
                </div>
                <div>
                    This is why we can talk of Signature Economies in the plural, while still remembering that such plurality is made meaningfully valuable by individual speech acts on a shared ledger. It is this interplay of personal expression and collective context that allows us to imagine <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html">interdependent architectures</a> in which we can “<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4105763">embed security in sociality</a>”.
                </div>
                <div>
                    As the meaning of ‘ownership’ shifts, it drags other critical terms along with it, like ‘social security’. This has a cascading effect, such that words like ‘welfare’ may come to mean more than just financial stability secured by bureaucracy, signifying—in addition to the financial—our access to and participation in authentic communication channels through which we establish, by consensus, verifiable state.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Just as a signature is both uniquely mine and that which binds me to a world beyond myself, our state is both singular and shared. Recognising this paradox allows us to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-4/self-enquiry/#signature-performances">imagine individual interfaces</a> to collective information that do not replicate one dominant economic <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-7/no-paradigm/">paradigm</a>, supposedly better than the last. Interfaces are the boundaries between distinct yet coextensive bodies; the places where we meet one another in our differentiated sameness; the personal routes to our shared root. Used <a href="https://www.mollymielke.com/cc#sig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">creatively</a>, interfaces can be more like permeable membranes which are not premised on inclusion and exclusion, but on how information is passed between. Framing our exploration in terms of how bits are transmitted rather than who controls them may allow for many different concepts of value to interface with one another in creative ways which don’t incentivise cancerous growth, but are self-sustaining, resilient, and responsible.

                    Perhaps this work is not about the right to control, but about cultivating responsibility? It may not seems so at first: phrases like ‘not your keys, not your coins’ are often used by those claiming to be sovereign individuals. If you hold the keys, then you have an absolute and unimpeachable right to sign as you please. It turns out, though, that managing your own keys responsibly is hard. The user experience of this is bad not because we lack great designers, but because responsibility is an inherently difficult feature for which to design.<sup>3</sup> This is because response-ability is not about discrete, individual actions which release the most dopamine, but  <strong>contextual relationships within a network</strong>.
                </div>
                <div>
                    This is the heart of it: ownership is claimed once and then defended via (violent) exclusion. Signed messages which change the state of a network no-one controls require <strong>recurring participation</strong>. The ‘shared’ in “shared history” is not an adjective: it is a verb. It is something we must keep doing in order for individual trans-actions to find expression in increasingly more relatable contexts.<sup>4</sup>
                </div>
                <div>{' '}
                    In this sense, <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-7/the-gift/#anonymous-and-lively">the gift</a> of being able to express what value means to you is always already bound to the responsibility you have to be aware of what you are saying and how you are speaking it into the world.

                <div>
                    Moreover, the ability to bear responsibility is a prerequisite for meaningful legal rights, a point made explicit in signature economies. Just as there is <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-2/money-speech/#math-beats-bureaucracy">no meaningful speech on-chain without cost</a>, any rights you may enjoy on-chain are simultaneous with the responsibility you bear for the keys used to sign for them. Used intentionally, digital bearer instruments could be about more than claims or access, extending to the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://orionmagazine.org/article/the-rights-of-the-land/">“right to care” and the “freedom to exercise responsibility”</a>. This kind of careful responsibility signifies the same internal
                    state as words like <i><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaitiaki">kaitiaki</a></i>: guardianship that is about relationship, not control; about response-ability <i>to</i>, not responsibility <i>for</i>.<sup>5</sup>
                </div>
                <div>
                    Can we create a culture where value is propagated by ongoing response, rather than held captive in possessions? Where wealth is rooted in care, rather than control?<sup>6</sup> Can we create environments where what I hold is made valuable because of the community to which it binds me? Where <a href="https://purpose-economy.org/content/uploads/purposebooklet_en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">profits serve shared purpose</a> within collective frameworks premised on more wholesome self-governance? This is what good mechanism design crafts: incentive structures which create the context required for people to sign a <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://kernel.community/en/learn/module-2/engineering/#further-references">communal record of the things they care for most as individuals</a>. The intercourse of personal meaning and collective memory is the root of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.kernel.community/en/learn/module-7/giving/#further-afield">healthy reciprocity</a>.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Realising all this requires one, simple recognition: wealth means “<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://kernel.community/en/conversation/reciprocity/">having enough to share</a>” because who you are is already enough.

Two wonderful phrases that carry the same kind of paradoxical structure are the isiZulu saying, “<i>umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu</i>”: a human being is only a human being through other human beings, and the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.kernel.community/en/conversation/hospitality/deep-response/#commons--autonomy">Kanien'kehá:ka</a> phrase “<i>I’ionrhek thiia’tionha’ak nonen tion’kwatorohon</i>”: we are individual but we discover ourselves within the collective. Both sayings hold the possibility and promise of individuation: you can become a full human being; but you can only do so in community. You can only do so through fulfilling your responsibilities in relationship, not through asserting your rights.

                    The word ‘economies’ contains this same double-directedness. It comes from the Greek <i>oikos</i>, which means ‘house’. Sustainable household management requires micro insights into each of our habits, as well as macro perspectives of our shared habitations, including the planet which <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://emergencemagazine.org/story/the-serviceberry/">houses us all
                    </a>. Home is an irreducible, internal feeling that simultaneously requires relationship and familiarity with others.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Similarly, meaningful words arise due to individual creativity <strong>within</strong> a community who agrees upon their use, which is why language itself is the only <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274">logically decentralized system</a> we know. When what we say and how we say it invites people in and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://andytudhope.africa/academy/communal-language/#love-this-sound">calls up a response</a>, meaning is made more widely accessible.<sup>7</sup> When we cast these new networks as economies of sign rather than of ownership, then the game becomes one of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/uN4g0Sr3jhs?t=1918">actively finding more people able to respond</a>, rather than extracting rent from my exclusive right to some artificially scarce series of bits.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Signature economies emerge from the shared negotiation of public consensus rules, the clearly priced <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/crytic/evm-opcodes">opcodes</a> which implement such rules, and the speech acts they enable which do not require the threat of violence in order to be executed. The value of such economies is held in <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://libraryofbabel.info/bookmark.cgi?finduncontained">signed messages</a>  which enact individual meaning within the context of a collective record that no-one controls. This doesn’t mean we can now name (or code) the dao; it just means we can iteratively sign into existence the kinds of shared state which will allow individuals to experience harmoniously what words like <i>dao</i> signify in their personal contexts.

                    How can I take responsibility without the resources to make reading my signature worthwhile for others, though? I have tried to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/@cryptowanderer/merry-merkle-magic-1458a25ee2dd">speak my imagination</a> into existence, and have seen the limits of such work. My signatures do not move markets. However, markets are not the arbiters of meaning, they are mechanisms for efficient resource allocation. Your signature is not made meaningful by its effects: your signature is meaningful by virtue of its singular existence. New forms of ignorance and <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/3HYlbg6RKMA?t=1145">injustice will always appear</a>, yet knowing this and still having the creativity to iterate over incentive structures is what will continually imbue our shared record with <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/LwLP62fL83k?t=371">true beauty</a>.

                    There is also another connotation waiting for us in the word ‘economy’: to use sparingly. The messages we sign as a means of maintaining our shared record cannot be censored by anyone, but they can be seen by everyone, so be careful what kinds of money you make meaningful. With programmable power comes permanent accountability. To better understand the deeper meaning of 'power', though, we once again turn to the poets:
